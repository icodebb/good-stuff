Thanks for the great work.

== Software

=== IDE and Editor

==== VS Code
===== Pros & Cons
* Pros
  ** Fast than Kdevelop using remotely on Ubuntu with MobaXterm
  ** Not much settings used as C Editor

===== Extensions
* https://microsoft.github.io/vscode-codicons/dist/codicon.html[Todo Tree Codicons] useful for work, e.g. "icon": "$(bell-slash)" for BLOCKED.
* `Awesome Emacs Keymap` When using in Linux with MobaXterm. 

===== Themes
* `Super One Dark` Theme for Ubuntu
* `Dark(Visual Studio C/C++)` for Windows
* `vscode-icons` I like the icon for AsciiDoc. 

==== PyCharm
* Pros
  ** Great for Python programming.
  ** Great Markdown editor with `Markdown Split Editor` and `Markdown Editor` modes.

==== Kdevelop
* Pros
  ** `Show uses` feature
  ** `Auto complete` feature
  ** Hints for function arguments
* Cons
  ** `Search in files` doesn't work on Linux with remote X if project path is too deep e.g. in a bitbake sandbox tmp folder.

==== AsciidocFX
* Great for PlantUML and other Diagrams.
* Good NOTE flags.
* Good group feature.

==== Sublime Text
* Pros
  ** Fonts, best feeling even with same font compare to other editors.
  ** Highlights, e.g AsciiDoc and C/C++.
  ** Indent for AsciiDoc
* Cons
  ** No preview for AsciiDoc

* Cons
  ** Matched words after selection not highlighted.

==== CodeLite
* Good for C/C++.

==== IntelliJ IDEA Community
* Pros
  ** Great for HTML.
* Cons
  ** The auto indent is a double-edged sword, you need to take care the <li><h2>xx</h3></li>, the </li> needs to be in a new line.

==== Phoenix Code
* Pros
  ** Search feature is fast.
  ** HTML Collapse/Expand All feature
  ** Bookmarks Panel
  ** Collapse All/Expand All
  ** Auto Indent
  ** Indent Guide (the line)
